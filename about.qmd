ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of the digital universe. I'm thrilled to have you here. 

I'm Amrita, a passionate painter, dancer, and music enthusiast. I find solace in trekking and my greatest joy is spending time with my cat. 

For the ETC5523 Communicating with Data Assessment, I've embarked on a creative journey that I'm thrilled to share with you. I've created a website that I've titled "Artistry Unveiled: Global Artistry & Gender Insights." This platform serves as a canvas for two distinct but interconnected blogs: "Exploring Artists and Artworks" and "Gender Dynamics in Art."
